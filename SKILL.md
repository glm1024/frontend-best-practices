description: Frontend development best practices for building and reviewing user-facing UI with fewer rework loops. Use when creating, changing, polishing, or reviewing frontend interfaces, especially async buttons, forms, modals, drawers, tables, filters, uploads, dashboards, admin tools, responsive layouts, loading/error/empty/success states, accessibility, UX copy, visual polish, or browser-validation decisions. Also use when the user mentions frontend best practices, repeated rework, duplicate clicks, 防重复提交, 不好看, 返工, 状态不完整, or wants UI quality checked before handoff.

# Frontend Best Practices

Use this skill as a frontend quality gate before handoff. The goal is to reduce the loop where the agent implements a UI, the user clicks through it, finds predictable interaction gaps, and the agent patches them afterward.

## Core Workflow

1. Classify the surface and intent.
   - Product/admin/dashboard/tool UI: prioritize restrained utility, information density, predictable controls, and stable workflows.
   - Brand/landing/portfolio/game UI: use stronger visual direction, but still preserve interaction completeness.
   - Narrow bug or polish request: keep the existing product shape unless the user asks for a redesign.
   - "Looks bad" or "average" feedback: treat it as a direction or taste problem, not just a CSS tweak.

2. Read local context before designing.
   - Inspect nearby screens, shared components, design tokens, form/table/request helpers, permissions, route patterns, and validation/build scripts.
   - Prefer existing components, idioms, and project rules over new abstractions.
   - If present, use project taste/context files such as `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or local style docs.

3. Implement with complete states.
   - Any async write action needs both visual feedback and a method-level re-entry guard.
   - Do not rely only on a disabled button; protect the handler too.
   - Preserve usable content during refreshes when possible. Avoid sudden page-level dimming for local or fast operations.

4. Review before handoff.
   - Check state completeness, edge cases, responsiveness, copy, accessibility, performance, and project fit.
   - Validate at the lightest layer that can catch the likely regression; use a real browser for complex interaction or responsive behavior.

## Reference Routing

- Read [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) at the start of substantial frontend work or when choosing validation scope.
- Read [interaction-states.md](references/interaction-states.md) when touching buttons, forms, tables, modals, drawers, uploads, filters, async requests, optimistic UI, permissions, or list refreshes.
- Read [product-ui-taste.md](references/product-ui-taste.md) for admin/product tools, dashboard UI, RuoYi-style systems, visual polish, Chinese product copy, or user taste alignment.
- Read [review-checklist.md](references/review-checklist.md) before final handoff, and whenever the user asks for a review or audit.

## Hard Defaults

- Prefer local, scoped loading states over full-page overlays unless the whole page is genuinely blocked.
- For writes, use `submitting`/`pending`/row-action locks, set them before the request can race, and release them on every failure, validation-cancel, and success path.
- Prevent stale read responses from overwriting newer UI state when filters, pagination, tabs, or route params can change quickly.
- Treat empty states, no-result states, permission states, long CJK text, slow networks, API errors, and duplicate user actions as normal production paths.
- Keep admin/product UI restrained: no marketing hero, decorative gradients, card-on-card layouts, or novelty interactions unless the product context calls for them.
- When reviewing, lead with findings and file references. When implementing, finish with changed surfaces, validation performed, and any residual risk.
